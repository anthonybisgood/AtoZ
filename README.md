A new language: AtoZ
AtoZ is a Java-like, statically typed language that is interpreted using Python. Our language implements Java like features including semicolons to determine end-of-lines and brackets for loops and if statements. 
However, our language does take different paths with keywords, declarations, and implementations of features.
